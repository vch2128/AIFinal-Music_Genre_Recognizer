This task is about music genre classification with LSTM. Here are the steps to implement it:

- The data we used save in `music` folder is GTZAN dataset with some adjustments.
- Convert the music into `.au` files and split each of them into 30-second segments.
- Use `DataProcessing.py` to extract features, turning the audio samples into model-processing data.
